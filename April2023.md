### 苏纳克促英国摈弃“反数学”心态

we make jokes about not being able to do math.

It's **socially acceptable** (社会欣然接受的).

We say things like "oh, maths I can't do, that's not for me" and everyone laughs.

But we'd never make a joke like that about not being able to read.

We've got to change this **anti-math mindset** (反数学心态).

We've got to start pricing numeracy for what it is —— A key skill, every bit as essential as reading, I admit.

As I said, **not gonna happen overnight**, right?

This is **a big, long-term reform** (一项重大的长期改革), then I can come back and then talk to you about what does that mean for the new teachers, how we're going to teach the course and how we're going to **roll it out** (推广).

Right, we respect we were there and we support our teachers.

And I'm so grateful to them for the **incredible job** they do.

And that's why we worked really hard to find a way to come to what I thought was a reasonable and fair settlement on pay.

And **it represented about an 8% increase for** most teachers, **around a 13% increase for** new teachers.

Obviously, I'm disappointed.

I said I don't want our kids' education to be disrupted.

I think no one wants to see that, our door is always open and we continue to hope that we can **find a way through**.
